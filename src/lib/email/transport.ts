/**
 * Sending email, and the one decision that shapes everything under this
 * directory: **outside production, nothing is sent.**
 *
 * The portal's recipients are real members, and their addresses are in the
 * database a developer runs against. A transport that quietly works in
 * development is a transport that mails 300 people the first time somebody
 * runs the wrong test. So the API key lives only in the production
 * environment, and without it {@link sendEmail} writes to the console and
 * reports success — the queue drains, the code path is exercised, and no one
 * is written to.
 *
 * Resend has an SDK. This uses `fetch` instead, for the same reason the rest
 * of this codebase reaches for a dependency only when the alternative is
 * maintaining something genuinely hard: one POST to one endpoint is not that.
 * Sending is deliberately the only thing the key can do — create it with
 * *Sending access*, restricted to the sending domain, and it can neither read
 * what was sent nor manage the account.
