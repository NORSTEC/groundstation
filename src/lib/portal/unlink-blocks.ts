/**
 * Why a sign-in account cannot be removed, in the portal's own words.
 *
 * The database decides — `portal_account_unlink_block` asks the same guard the
 * removal runs — and this only translates. Shared between a person's own
 * profile and Portal management so the two cannot end up describing the same
 * refusal differently; they differ only in who is being told, which is what
 * `voice` selects.
