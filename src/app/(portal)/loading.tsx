/**
 * Shown while the page below Groundstation shell is still being rendered.
 *
 * Without this file the App Router has nowhere to stream into, so a click on a
 * navigation link does nothing visible until the whole server render finishes —
 * the address bar does not move, the old page stays put, and the only signal
 * that anything happened is that Groundstation has stopped responding. Every
 * Groundstation page resolves the signed-in person before it can ask for anything
 * else, so that wait is never zero.
 *
 * The shapes below are deliberately generic. A skeleton that mimics one page's
 * layout is wrong on every other page in the group, and a wrong guess reads
 * worse than an honest block.
